Thanks, fixed:

I also fixed it in sparc64 where I'd made the same mistake.

I haven't incorporated your defconfig patch in this; most arch defconfigs
are horribly out of date (including x86..) so I'm not trying to maintain
them.  I also made a few more drivers depend on ISA or EISA or PCI for
the benefit of those who don't have them.
