Neither user nor kernel can get at that page.  If _PAGE_R is not set
we get a real fault no matter who attempts the access.

That's correct.

Yes this one is a bug and not intentional.

Keith W., we need to fix this.  Probably the simplest fix is just to
drop the SRMMU_VALID bit.

No, if it's SRMMU_VALID the hardware lets the translation succeed and
like on x86 the hardware does the page table walk and thus the SRMMU_REF
bit setting.
