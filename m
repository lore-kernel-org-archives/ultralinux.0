Perhaps this rings a bell for someone:

I just noticed something odd that might be the actual cause of the 
problem. I used to be able to netboot the SUN as well, just slam the 
image into /tftpboot on the TFTP server and done. However, now I get 
'Fast Instruction Access MMU Miss' no matter what image I try to boot 
(most notably, the flash PROM updates from SUN). Perhaps there is 
something set incorrectly in the OpenBoot I should look at?
